                <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    My research interests are in the intersection of cybersecurity, formal verification and programming languages. I hope to formally verify the security properties of real-life programs, ideally executable code, so we can be confident that the critical code we depend on satisfies the security specifications. I believe in the power of security by design, and programming language theory, supported by rigorous mathematical foundations, is a promising way towards the goal. I hope to study how to represent programs and specifications at different levels of abstraction such that the representations can express meaningful properties and are still amenable to computer-aided formal verification.

                <h3>Research Experience</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Research Engineer in Cybersecurity (2022 - 2023)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    Supervisors: Khin Mi Mi Aung, Chao Jin<br>
                    I participated in a project that uses homomorphic encryption (HE) to securely perform the design of experiments (DOE) process in a collaborative setting and presented the work at the 5th HomomorphicEncryption.org Standards Workshop. Collaborating with a colleague, I developed a Python library for compressing artificial neural networks so that the model inference has a smaller multiplicative depth, which matters when the computation is in HE. Moreover, I worked on a project that applies HE to machine learning for privacy-preserving fake image detection.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Final-Year Project in Robustness Evaluation of Attention Neural Networks (2021 - 2022)<br>
                    University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br>
                    Supervisor: Marta Kwiatkowska<br>
                    I trained neural network models with attention mechanisms based on existing literature and evaluated their robustness. I found evidence suggesting that attention neural networks may not be more robust than models without attention mechanisms for image classification.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Summer Attachment in Lattice-Based Cryptography (2021)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    Supervisors: Khin Mi Mi Aung, Benjamin Hong Meng Tan<br>
                    I learnt about the mathematical problems underlying lattice-based cryptography, studied a paper on lattice-based signatures and gave a presentation on the topic.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>Research attachment in Computational Biology (2017 - 2018)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    Supervisors: Zheng Yang Chin, Kai Keng Ang<br>
                    I designed and conducted experiments to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from subjects while the subjects performed mental arithmetic. Using the data, I trained a machine learning model to distinguish between different mental arithmetic difficulty levels based on the EEG signals.</p></li>
