                <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
                <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    My research interest is in the intersection of cybersecurity, formal verification and programming languages. I hope to formally verify the security properties of real-life programs, ideally executable code, so programmers implementing cryptographic protocols can be confident that the resulting code achieves the security specifications. I believe in the power of security by design, and programming language theory, supported by rigorous mathematical foundations, is a promising way towards the goal. I hope to study how to design programming languages that are expressive enough for specific domains and produce compiled results that are amenable to computer-aided formal verification.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (2019 - 2022)<br>
                    University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br>
                    First Class Honours<br>
                    Cohort ranking: 1/43
                </p>

                <h3>Research Experience</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Research Engineer in Cybersecurity (2022 - Present)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    I have developed a Python library for compressing layers of an artificial neural network so that it requires a smaller multiplicative depth when evaluated in homomorphic encryption; I am working on a project to apply homomorphic encryption to machine learning.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Final-Year Project in Robustness Evaluation of Attention Neural Networks (2021 - 2022)<br>
                    University of Oxford, United Kingdom<br>
                    I trained neural network models with attention mechanisms based on existing literature and evaluated their robustness. I found evidence suggesting that attention neural networks for image classification may not be more robust than models without attention mechanisms.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Summer Attachment in Lattice-Based Cryptography (2021)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    I learnt about the underlying mathematical problems of lattice-based cryptography, studied a paper on lattice signatures and gave a presentation about the paper.</p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>Research attachment in Computational Biology (2017 - 2018)<br>
                    Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore<br>
                    I designed and conducted experiments to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of subjects while they perform mental arithmetic, and I trained a machine learning model to distinguish mental arithmetic difficulty levels based on the EEG signals.</p></li>
                </ul>
